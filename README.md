# Unforgettable
Unforgettable is intended to be a small yet enjoyable and addictive browser-based game that tests the user's memory with rapid intensity. The game should be easy to pick up for new users and quick and simple to play for both new and returning users. The site should be intuitive to navigate, pleasing on the eye, and not distract from the main game loop.

## UX
### User Stories:  
- The main goal of this website for new users is to quickly convey what the game is and how to play it. New users should instinctively know what each section of the page does and how to interact with the site. The first area of focus should be the instructions which should effectively educate the user on the basics of the game. Importantly, the website should seem easy to interact with to encourage the user to continue using it. The target audience of this website is anyone interested in quick brain training in a small and simple package.
- The requirements for returning users are largely equivalent. The main focus for repeat visitors of the site is that the instructions do not serve as an annoying obstacle to be maneuvered upon each load of the site. The experience should remain consistent for a returning user every time they revisit the site.

## Design
### Colour Scheme:

Above is the colour scheme for the unforgettable website, courtesy of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).  

For this site, I wanted the colour scheme to stand back and let the main game sell the website. For this reason I chose to use only 3 main colours (Spanish Orange, Gunmetal, and CG Blue) and relied on shades of these to create a slightly more dynamic feel. I wanted the main shades to be orange because I find it to be an easier colour on the eye when viewed on a digital display and it also allowed for strong contrast with the blue used on the site. Additionally, I used a slightly orange-tinted white and a charcoal-ish grey instead of a stark white and black to continue the muted atmosphere.

### Typography:
![Example text for both fonts used on the unforgettable website: Arvo and Martel Sans.](assets/images/unforgettable-fonts.png)  
Above are the fonts used for this website: Arvo and Martel Sans courtesy of [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Arvo is the font used for the site headers and buttons. Whilst I wanted the game to be the selling point of the website, the first thing a new user will see upon loading unforgettable is the header so I needed a font which was striking and impactful to encourage the user to remain on the site. It was important to me that the website still possessed character despite its small size and little text content and I believe Arvo is the perfect font to create an impression even when used sparingly.  
Martel Sans is the font used for the instruction text and, more importantly, the output display area. Whereas Arvo is intended to stand out, the role of Martel Sans is to convey important information when it is needed and to blend in when it is not. I didn't want the instruction text to obstruct the user's experience whilst they were playing the game so I wanted to choose a font that was plain and pleasant and nothing more. The biggest consideration in choosing Martel Sans over other simple fonts was how this font handled numbers, as they are the key element of the game and therefore the whole site. The numbers in Martel Sans all sit at the same level and have the same height which is perfect for this website because it just makes the random digits feel more consistent for the user.

## Features
### Header:
![Header of unforgettable website](assets/images/unforgettable-header.png)  

The header of the website very simply has a strong orange background colour and the main title of the page, coloured gunmetal. It is designed to be eye-catching yet unobtrusive. I used negative letter-spacing values on the title text because I liked the way the individual characters blend neatly together with the Arvo font. The header provides value to the user because it is inviting and creates the general 'mood' of the site.

### Instructions:
![Instructions text on the unforgettable website](assets/images/unforgettable-instructions.png)  

The instructions text is directly below the header and therefore the next place a new user's eye settles. The text is kept concise to not overwhelm the user and contains all the basic rules of the game. Additionally, the sentence which refers to starting the game is a darker shade compared to the rest of the text to make it more noticeable at a glance and indicate it's importance. This is important for any user who happens to skim the information as it prevents frustration from struggling to run the game. This area of text is designed plainly so that returning users can ignore it and jump straight to the game. The instructions text is valuable to the user because it lets them know how to play the game and doesn't remove from the game experience.

### Difficulty Bar:
![Difficulty bar on the unforgettable website](assets/images/unforgettable-difficulty-bar.png)  

The difficulty bar contains 3 buttons which all start the game on different difficulties (easy, normal, hard). The buttons change colour from blue to orange when hovered over with a mouse to indicate their clickability to the user. The difficulty bar is valuable to the user as it groups all of the difficulty buttons in one place and allows the user to run the game. The 3 levels of difficulty are important because they increase the range of users who can enjoy the website and allow a sense of progression for those who invest time into getting better at the game.

### Statistics Bar:
![Statistics bar on the unforgettable website](assets/images/unforgettable-stats-bar.png)  

The statistics bar contains the game timer (featuring an icon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)) and the tallies for correct and incorrect answers. Once a game is started, the timer begins counting down from 60 seconds to 0. It is a valuable feature of the stats bar because it lets the user know how long they have left in their current game and adds a fun level of pressure and excitement to the game. The scores both reset to 0 at the start of a game and increment by 1 per correct or incorrect answer respectively. The scores are valuable to the user because they provide immediate feedback on their ability and allows them to create their own goals/milestones (e.g. can I complete normal mode without getting a single answer wrong?). The scores also add a competitivity to the game which encourages users to tell their friends about the site to try and beat each others scores.
