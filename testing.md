# Unforgettable Testing
## Automated Testing  
- All of the HTML written for this site passes through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no errors.
- All of the CSS written for this site passes through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors. 
- All of the JavaScript written for this site passes through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) with only one warning: 'Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (runGame)'. I believe that in the context of the code surrounding the function of note, the semantics are clear and as such I'm happy to leave the code as it is.
